1) Introductions:

Here are some very simple introductions about Skinamp. The skins it produces are only usable with Winamp 2.x. Please make sure that you have installed Winamp 2.x on your machine (but it is not neccessary). 

Step 1) Run the program
     2) Click on Load picture
     3) Search your drives and select a picture (bmp or jpeg)
     4) Specify the zoom, or the cliping type (part, stretched, tiled)
     5) Click on the tabs to view and specify the options for the windows (main, equalizer, playlist, ...)
     6) If your skin seams ready, press save. A Dialog appears. Select the parts of the skin, which should be saved and enter the name of the skin. You must enter the full path to the location, the skin should be saved to (Winamp directory). If you enable the wsz-checkbox, the skin will be saved as the .wsz-archiv. Then press Save!
     7) - Run Winamp and select your skin (Alt+S).
        - Make sure, that the skin is already selected in Winamp. Then you can press the Test button, and Winamp will reload the current skin.
